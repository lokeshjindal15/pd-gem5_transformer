iPython set-up
###############################
Follow this link upto step 3: https://blog.safaribooksonline.com/2013/12/12/start-ipython-notebook/
Afterwards:
pip install --upgrade "ipython[all]"

This might give you some permission errors.. simply do "sudo chmod 777 <directory on which permission error is thrown>"

then run tests using "iptest"
This gave me error saying import error.
sudo pip install --upgrade mock
sudo pip install --upgrade pyzmq
 and similarly for anything else...
